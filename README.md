# `deno_rusty_markdown`

Deno bindings for [`pulldown-cmark`][1], a CommonMark-compliant Markdown parser
made in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly. Also supports parsing YAML frontmatter.

The files in the `pkg` folder are autogenerated by the script `build.ts`, and
contain the webassembly code, compressed and encoded into base64, alongside
some boilerplate code for interacting with it.
